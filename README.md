The input of neural network has not only numerical value but also spatial position. 
Then how to process the input position information to avoid neural network training error?

I want to know the forecast of reliability for the reform measures of distribution network
the reform measures: DG capacity,DG location in the IEE49 nodes
DG capacity=[[1.2,2.3,2.4],[3.4,5.6,6.7],[7.8,4.4,6.7]]
DG location: we limit the range of installed nodes: 1,14,23,30
so the question: how to handle the location of DG nodes to the nerual network?
thank you very much
